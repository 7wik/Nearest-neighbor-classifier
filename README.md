A simple yet optimized implementations of nearest neighbor classifier on MNIST dataset
Both these implementations(nn.py, nn2.py) are based on this identity for euclidean distance between the vectors <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x_j, t_i"> i.e., <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=||t_i - x_j||^2_2 = t_i^Tt_i %2B x_j^Tx_j -2t_i^Tx_j">
